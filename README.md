# ML-Production-Practice
The purpose of the project is to transform a ML predictive project from jupyternotebook environment to productioon environment. We focus on model implementation, CI/CD and microservices. 
# Poetry 
Our project uses poetry to specify and manage dependencies.  In Poetry, adding, removing, or updating dependencies is streamlined with simple commands (poetry add, poetry remove, etc.), and the pyproject.toml file is updated automatically. For a complex project, poetry can ensure identical environments across different systems.
